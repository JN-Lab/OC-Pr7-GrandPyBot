# OC-Pr7-GrandPyBot
Repository for Project 7 from Openclassrooms cursus in Software Developement

## Project Description
This is a web application to help user to find an address and learn more about the story of this location.

### Functionalities
* AJAX interactions : the user send his question by pressing enter key and the answer is directly printed on the screen, without reloading the webpage.
* Use of GoogleMap API and Media Wiki API.
* Nothing is saved. If the user reloads the webpage, all the history is lost.

### User Path
The user opens his browser and enter the specific URL address (Not available yet). The webpage which is loaded owns the following elements:
* header : logo with tagline
* main zone : zone for conversing with the application
* footer : firsname and lastname, link with github repository and other social networks links.

Here is a typical interaction with the application:
* The user writes "Hi GrandPy! Do you know where I can find the Openclassrooms address?" in the form field and press Enter key.
* The message is visible in the chat zone with the older ones. An icon indicates that GrandPy is thinking.
* The answer is appears: "Of course! Here is it: 7 cité Paradis, 75010 Paris." Below, there is a Google map with a flag showing the location.
* GrandPy sends a new message: "Did I told you the story of this area? The cité Paradis is a public street located in the XXe arrondissement of Paris. It looks like a T (the letter).
